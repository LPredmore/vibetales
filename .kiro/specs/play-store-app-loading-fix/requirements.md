# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VibeTales app is experiencing critical loading failures on new devices when downloaded from the Google Play Store. The app starts to load briefly, then disappears, while working correctly on devices where it was previously installed and in privacy browsers. This indicates a complex issue involving TWA (Trusted Web Activity) configuration, caching strategies, authentication persistence, or service worker behavior that specifically affects fresh installations from the Play Store.

## Glossary

- **TWA (Trusted Web Activity)**: Android's technology for wrapping web apps as native Android apps distributed through Play Store
- **Play Store Installation**: Fresh app installation from Google Play Store on a device that never had the app before
- **Service Worker**: Background script that handles caching, offline functionality, and app updates
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Web application that uses modern web capabilities to provide app-like experience
- **Cache Busting**: Technique to force browsers to fetch fresh resources instead of using cached versions
- **Authentication Persistence**: Maintaining user login state across app sessions and device restarts
- **Emergency Recovery Mode**: Fallback system that activates when the app fails to load normally

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user downloading VibeTales from the Play Store, I want the app to load successfully on first launch, so that I can start using the app immediately without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads VibeTales from the Play Store on a new device, THE VibeTales_App SHALL load the main interface within 10 seconds
2. WHEN the app encounters loading errors on first launch, THE VibeTales_App SHALL display a recovery screen with clear troubleshooting options
3. WHEN the app fails to load due to cache issues, THE VibeTales_App SHALL automatically attempt cache clearing and reload
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor during first launch, THE VibeTales_App SHALL provide offline-capable fallback content
5. WHEN the TWA container fails to initialize properly, THE VibeTales_App SHALL detect the failure and provide alternative loading mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining VibeTales, I want comprehensive diagnostics for Play Store installation failures, so that I can quickly identify and resolve loading issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app fails to load on a new device, THE VibeTales_App SHALL capture detailed diagnostic information including user agent, referrer, and error messages
2. WHEN loading failures occur, THE VibeTales_App SHALL log TWA-specific environment variables and Android WebView settings
3. WHEN authentication fails during first launch, THE VibeTales_App SHALL record session recovery attempts and Supabase connection status
4. WHEN service worker registration fails, THE VibeTales_App SHALL document the failure reason and provide manual registration options
5. WHEN emergency debug mode is activated, THE VibeTales_App SHALL provide exportable logs for technical support analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with an existing VibeTales installation, I want app updates to work seamlessly without breaking functionality, so that I can continue using the app without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app updates through the Play Store, THE VibeTales_App SHALL preserve user authentication state and preferences
2. WHEN cache versions conflict after an update, THE VibeTales_App SHALL automatically resolve conflicts and migrate to new cache structure
3. WHEN the service worker updates, THE VibeTales_App SHALL handle the transition without causing app crashes or data loss
4. WHEN manifest changes occur during updates, THE VibeTales_App SHALL refresh TWA configuration without requiring manual intervention
5. WHEN authentication tokens expire during an update, THE VibeTales_App SHALL attempt automatic token refresh before prompting for re-login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a VibeTales user on a slow or unreliable network, I want the app to handle poor connectivity gracefully during initial load, so that I can still access basic functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is slow during app startup, THE VibeTales_App SHALL display loading progress indicators with timeout handling
2. WHEN critical resources fail to load due to network issues, THE VibeTales_App SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
3. WHEN the app cannot connect to Supabase during startup, THE VibeTales_App SHALL provide offline mode with cached authentication
4. WHEN service worker installation fails due to network issues, THE VibeTales_App SHALL continue functioning without offline capabilities
5. WHEN manifest.json cannot be fetched, THE VibeTales_App SHALL use embedded fallback configuration to maintain basic functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a VibeTales user experiencing app crashes, I want easy recovery options that don't require technical knowledge, so that I can get back to using the app quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app fails to load after 10 seconds, THE VibeTales_App SHALL automatically display the emergency recovery screen
2. WHEN users select "Clear Cache & Reload" option, THE VibeTales_App SHALL remove all cached data and perform a fresh initialization
3. WHEN users select "Hard Reload" option, THE VibeTales_App SHALL bypass all caches and reload with cache-busting parameters
4. WHEN recovery options fail, THE VibeTales_App SHALL provide a "Safe Mode" link that loads with minimal features enabled
5. WHEN users need technical support, THE VibeTales_App SHALL generate downloadable diagnostic reports with anonymized system information
